# Diary Example App

This is a lightweight Go application that allows you to easily log and record a journal or diary.
It contains two endpoints: one for listing the journal for a single day, and one for creating a new entry in the journal.

This was built in 30 minutes, with tests included, using [Encore](https://encore.dev). It took 2 minutes to deploy, including with the database.

## Endpoints

Listing all my entries for a specific date:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/logbook/entries/2022-09-08" | jq
```

```json
{
  "Entries": [
    {
      "Id": 1,
      "Time": "2022-09-08T16:25:21.409544Z",
      "Text": "I cooked fried eggs this morning. I forgot how much I loved them!"
    }
  ]
}
```

Create new diary entry:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"Text":"I cooked fried eggs this morning. I forgot how much I loved them!"}' "http://localhost:4000/logbook/entries"
```

```json
{
  "Id": 6,
  "Time": "2022-09-08T16:25:21.409544Z",
  "Text": "I cooked fried eggs this morning. I forgot how much I loved them!"
}
```

## Install

```bash
brew install go@1.19.1
brew install encoredev/tap/encore
git clone git@github.com:encoredev/example-app-diary.git

```

## Deployment
